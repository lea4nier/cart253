# Alice in Wonderland
A game by LÃ©a Fournier

Created Fall 2023

Overview:

This is a simulation inspired by the book "Alice in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll.
The player is immersed into the world of the story as Alice after falling down the rabbit hole. 
They are met with multiple tasks and mini games to explore the whimsical world of Wonderland! 

I was very inspired by the darker and creepier elements of this story that is usually told for children. 
I took some of my favorite elements of the story such as (but not limited to) the little bottle labeled "drink me", the cheshire cat, painting white roses red, and teacups to create my own version. 

   Attributions:

"Alice's Adventure in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll, published 1893.
I have used many quotes from the book in my game, and it was my primary source of inspiration.

Alice image art: 

The illustration of Alice falling used in the states "Title1", "Title2", "Title3", and "Home" was made by Laura Barett.
I edited the image myself from a screenshot and changed the color from black to white.

 Code used from course examples:
 * "Garden.js", "Flower.js", and "Butterfly.js" were all written using the code from Week 8 of the course
    on Object-Oriented Programming.

 Code used from previous work:
 * "Alice.js", "Cup.js", "Title1.js", "Title2.js", "Title3.js", and "Home.js" were 
 created based on my "juggle-garden" exercise.  
    * Link to my exercise: https://github.com/lea4nier/cart253/tree/main/exercises/juggle-garden/js 
    * This code was created after following the Juggling simulation activity in Week 8.

 * The code used in "Bottle.js" and "DrinkMe.js" was used turned in as an exercise for the course for the assignment "Make Some Noise" after I had already begun working on this project as a prototype to explore how I would use sound in my project.
