# Project 1
Halloween has always been my favorite holiday and I wanted to create a game for spooky season. "Jack-O-Lantern Builder!" is a game where the user drags and drops decorations (eyes, mouth, and nose) to decorate their own Jack-O-Lantern. I made this game to resemble the flash player games I grew up playing as a child. I made aesthetic choices to be similar to games from the early 2000's. I drew all of the eyes, mouths, noses, buttons, and titles myself. The images of the cat and pumpkin are from clipart.com.
